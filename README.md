# ollieg.codes - Legacy Site

The source code of the legacy version of my website is now available as a public archive.

The code is quite messy as the codebase was converted from vanilla JS to TS mid way through the project. Additionally, some test features that were axed still have methods defined.

## Important publishing note

Unlike newer sites of mine, the Handlebars compilation is NOT run at the same time as webpack. Run `npm run hb` separately to see changes.
